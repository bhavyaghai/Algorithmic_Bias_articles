[Overcoming Algorithm Aversion: People Will Use Imperfect Algorithms If They Can (Even Slightly) Modify Them](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2643)
The above paper shows that people were more likely to use an algorithm and accept its errors if given the opportunity to modify the algorithm themselves, even if it meant making it perform imperfectly. This paper bolsters the need to have a human-in-the-loop process for decision making.
